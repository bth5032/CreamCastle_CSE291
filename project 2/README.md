### Description
This project has two primary functions:
* Logisitic regresssion for the classification of handwritten '0' and '1'
* Softmax regression for the classification of handwritten digits {'0',...,'9'}

### Dataset
The data comes from the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.  Data has been processed from IDX format into Numpy format

### Code Base
There are two basic functions, logisiticregression.py and softmaxregression.py

Helper code for preprocessing, gradient descent is found in helper_functions.py

Mathematical expressions are found in math_functions.py
